Hello, and welcome to the CoSocial Github org.

CoSocial is a community service co-op that runs non-profit social media for Canadians.

~~We use Github for a few private repos around infrastructure that members of the TechOps Working Group have access to.~~

**We've moved our git presence to a self-hosted Gitea instance: https://git.cosocial.info/CoSocial-Canada**
